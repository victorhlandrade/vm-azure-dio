DIO Challenge – Creating Virtual Machines on Azure.

I will demonstrate step by step how to create virtual machines on Azure. In this activity, I chose to set up a multi-zone environment and use the load balancing feature to ensure high availability.

Step 1 – Select the hamburger menu > Virtual Machines > Create > Azure Virtual Machine.

Step 2 – I entered the name of my VM and kept the default region.

Step 3 – I then selected the availability zone I wanted to use. I chose all three zones in my region to ensure greater service availability. I kept the default security settings recommended by Azure and selected an Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS virtual machine.

Step 4 – Here you can change the size of your virtual machine. I chose to keep the size recommended by Azure.

Step 6 – In Networking, define your subnet and the address space to be used. We will use the default settings provided by Azure.

Step 7 – Since we chose multiple availability zones, we will create a load balancer to distribute the incoming requests.

Step 8 – Here we define the name of the load balancer and keep the other options as default.

Step 9 – We keep the default options and select the newly created load balancer.

Step 10 – Keep the remaining options as default and click Review + Create.

Step 16 – After removing your virtual machines, also remove the resources to avoid future charges.
